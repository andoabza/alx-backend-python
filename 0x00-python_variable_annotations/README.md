# Python Variable Annotations

This repository contains examples and exercises related to variable annotations in Python.


## Introduction

Variable annotations in Python allow you to provide type hints for variables. They are a way to specify the expected type of a variable without actually enforcing it at runtime. This can help improve code readability, maintainability, and can also be useful for static type checkers.

In this repository, you will find examples and exercises that demonstrate how to use variable annotations effectively in Python.
